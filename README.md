# VLFFM - VLF File Manager for PSP

VLFFM (VLF File Manager) unlike other file manager applications for the PSP, it's the first of its kind to use the native VLF library (XMB like interface). Although it isn't a fully functional file manager due to the constraints of working with an incomplete VLF library, it does still offer the basic features necessary. However, I would still consider this application something that is merely just a proof of concept.
